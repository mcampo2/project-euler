# Project Euler
General solutions for the first 100 problems of projecteuler.net

**Live Version [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mcampo2/project-euler/blob/master/index.html).**

If I do manage to get to 100, I will fork this into my private GitLab as posting solutions past the first 100 problems is against the rules.
