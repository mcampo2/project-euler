    <h1>Product-sum Numbers</h1>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with 1, 2, 9, and
           6 respectively, we form a square number: 1296 = 36<sup>2</sup>. What
           is remarkable is that, by using the same digital substitutions, the
           anagram, RACE, also forms a square number: 9216 = 96<sup>2</sup>.
           We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and
           specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a
           different letter have the same digital value as another letter.</p>
        <p>Using <a href="0098_words.txt">words.txt</a> (right click and 'Save
           Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand
           common English words, find all the square anagram word pairs (a
           palindromic word is NOT considered to be an anagram of itself).</p>
        <p>What is the largest square number formed by any member of
           such a pair?</p>
        <p>NOTE: All anagrams formed must be contained in the given
           text file.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The largest square number formed by any member of the square anagram
           word pairs of <a href="0098_words.txt">words.txt</a> is
           <b><span id="solution">???</span></b>.</p>
        <button id="solve">Solve</button>
    </div>

            text = text.split(',').map(str => str.replace(/"/g, ''));
