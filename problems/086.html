    <h1>Cuboid Route</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring 6 by 5 by
           3, and a fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the
           surfaces of the room the shortest "straight line" distance from S to
           F is 10 and the path is shown on the diagram.</p>
        <div><img src="0086.png"></div>
        <p>However, there are up to three "shortest" path candidates for
           any given cuboid and the shortest route doesn't always have
           integer length.</p>
        <p>It can be shown that there are exactly 2060 distinct cuboids,
           ignoring rotations, with integer dimensions, up to a maximum size of
           <i>M</i> by <i>M</i> by <i>M</i>, for which the shortest route has
           integer length when <i>M</i> = 100. This is the least value of
           <i>M</i> for which the number of solutions first exceeds two
           thousand; the number of solutions when <i>M</i> = 99 is 1975.</p>
        <p>Find the least value of <i>M</i> such that the number of solutions
           first exceeds one million.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The least value of <i>M</i> such that the number of solutions
           first exceeds <input id="range" type="text" value="1000000">
           is <b><span id="solution">???</span></b>.</p>
