        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The number 3739 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it
           is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and
           remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7.  Similarly we can
           work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.</p>
        <p>Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from
           left to right and right to left.</p>
        <p>NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left
           to right and right to left are
           <b><span id="solution">???</span></b>.</p>
