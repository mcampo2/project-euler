    <h1>Lychrel Numbers</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is
           palindromic.</p>
        <p>Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,</p>
        <div>
            <p>349 + 943 = 1292</p>
            <p>1292 + 2921 = 4313</p>
            <p>4213 + 3124 = 7337</p>
        </div>
        <p>That is 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.</p>
        <p>Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers,
           like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a
           palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel
           number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the
           purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel
           until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every
           number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in
           less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing
           power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In
           fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty
           iterations before producing a palindrome:
           4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves
           Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.</p>
        <p>How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?</p>
        <p>NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the
           theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The count of Lychrel numbers below
           <input id="range" type="text" value="10000"> is
           <b><span id="solution">???</span></b>.</p>
        <button id="solve">Solve</button>
    </div>
    <script>
        function solve() {
            answer = 0;
            range = Math.abs(document.getElementById("range").value);
            
            document.getElementById("solution").textContent = answer;
        }
        
        document.getElementById("range").addEventListener("keydown",
            function(event) {
                if (event.key === "Enter") {
                    document.getElementById("solve").focus();
                    solve();
                }
            }
        );
        
        document.getElementById("solve").onclick = solve;
