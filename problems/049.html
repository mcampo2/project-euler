        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms
           increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three
           terms are prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are
           permutations of one another.</p>
        <p>There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or
           3-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other
           4-digit increasing sequence.</p>
        <p>What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in
           this sequence?</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in
           the only other sequence exhibiting the properties described above is
           <b><span id="solution">???</span></b>.</p>
