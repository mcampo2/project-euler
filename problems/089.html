    <div>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there
           are basic rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow
           some numbers to be expressed in more than one way there is always a
           "best" way of writing a particular number.</p>
        <p>For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of
           writing the number sixteen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII</li>
            <li>VIIIIIIIIIII</li>
            <li>VVIIIIII</li>
            <li>XIIIIII</li>
            <li>VVVI</li>
            <li>XVI</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, according to the rules only XIIIIII and XVI are valid, and
           the last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses
           the least number of numerals.</p>
        <p>The 11K text file, <a href="0089_roman.txt">roman.txt</a> (right
           click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers
           written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; see
           <a href="https://projecteuler.net/about=roman_numerals">About...
           Roman Numerals</a> for the definitive rules for this problem.</p>
        <p>Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in
           their minimal form.</p>
        <p>Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain
           no more than four consecutive identical units.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The number of characters saved by writing each of the Roman numerals
          in the file in their minimal form is
          <b><span id="solution">???</span></b>.</p>
        <button id="solve">Solve</button>
    </div>
    <script>
        async function solve() {
            const file = await fetch('0089_roman.txt');
            let text = file.ok ? await file.text() : '';
            text = text.split('\n').filter(line => line.length > 0);
            answer = 0;
            document.getElementById("solution").textContent = answer;
        }
        
        document.getElementById("solve").onclick = solve;
