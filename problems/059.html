    <h1>XOR Decryption</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the
           preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
           Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and
           lowercase k = 107.</p>
        <p>A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes
           to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret
           key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same
           encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for
           example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.</p>
        <p>For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain
           text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would
           keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different
           locations, and without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt
           the message.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the
           modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is
           shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated
           cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is
           using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short
           enough to be memorable.</p>
        <p>Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of
           three lower case characters. Using
           <a href="0059_cipher.txt">0059_cipher.txt</a> (right click and
           'Save Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII
           codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common
           English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII
           values in the original text.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The sum of the ASCII values of the decryped text is
           <b><span id="solution">???</span></b>.</p>
        <button id="solve">Solve</button>
    </div>
    <script>
        async function solve() {
            answer = 0;

            const file = await fetch('0059_cipher.txt');
            let text = file.ok ? await file.text() : '';

            console.log(text);
            document.getElementById("solution").textContent = answer;
        }
        
        document.getElementById("solve").onclick = solve;
