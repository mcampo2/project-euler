        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Using <a href="./names.txt">names.txt</a> (right click and 'Save
           Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand
           first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then
           working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value
           by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.</p>
        <p>For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,
           which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the
           list.  So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 X 53 = 49714.</p>
        <p>What is the total of all the name scores in the file?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The total of all the name scores in the file is
           <b><span id="solution">???</span></b>.</p>
        <button id="solve">Solve</button>
    </div>
    <script>
        function solve() {
            answer = 0;
            
            document.getElementById("solution").textContent = answer;
        }
        
        document.getElementById("solve").onclick = solve;
