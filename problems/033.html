    <h1>Digit Cancelling Fractions</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced
           mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe
           that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling
           the 9s.</p>
        <p>We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial
           examples.</p>
        <p>There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction,
           less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator
           and denominator.</p>
        <p>If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common
           terms, find the value of the denominator.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The denominator of the product of the four non-trivial digit
           cancelling fractions in lowest common terms is
           <b><span id="solution">???</span></b>.</p>
